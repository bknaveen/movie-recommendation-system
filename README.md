Key Steps Explained
Data Loading:

The movies and credits datasets are loaded using pd.read_csv().
Merging occurs on the title column to combine relevant data.
Data Cleaning:

Null values in overview are dropped.
Data duplication is checked and found to be non-existent.
Non-essential columns are removed, keeping movie_id, title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
Transformation:

JSON-like strings in columns (genres, keywords, cast, crew) are converted into lists of relevant attributes using helper functions (convert and fetch_director).
Spaces in multi-word entries (e.g., "Science Fiction") are removed for better tag creation.
The overview string is split into a list of words.
Tag Creation:

A new tags column is created by concatenating overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
The tags are combined into a single string using " ".join() for each row, preparing data for NLP-based recommendations.
Next Steps
If you aim to build a recommendation system, you can proceed as follows:

Text Vectorization:

Convert tags into a numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization or CountVectorizer.
Cosine Similarity:

Compute pairwise similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity on the vectorized tags.
Recommendation Engine:

For a given movie, find the top N movies with the highest similarity scores.
User Interface:

Present the recommendations in a visually appealing way (e.g.,Pycharm/ web app with Flask/Django or dashboard using Streamlit).
